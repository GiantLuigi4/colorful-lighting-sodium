# ℹ️ Fork Information

This mod is a direct fork of erykczy's [Colorful Lighting](https://github.com/erykczy/colorful-lighting). Our main goal with this fork is to extend mod compatibility for use in larger modpacks. If you find an incompatible mod, please report it on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Camawama/colorful-lighting-sodium/issues) page.

# ❓ How It Works

This mod is built on top of Minecraft's vanilla lighting engine. It works by storing an extra set of data alongside the vanilla light levels, representing the color of the light in that block. When a light-emitting block is placed, the mod checks a list of configurable "emitters" to see if it should have a color. If it does, the color is propagated outwards, block by block, diminishing with distance, just like the vanilla engine.

When light passes through a semi-transparent block, the mod checks a list of "filters". These filters can change the color of the light passing through them. For example, red-stained glass can be configured to filter out all but the red component of light. The amount of light that is blocked can also be configured.

To avoid performance issues, all of this light propagation is handled on a separate thread, which means it won't slow down your game. The mod also uses techniques like trilinear interpolation to smooth out the colors between blocks, which creates a more natural look.

# ✨ Features

*   Different blocks can emit different colors
*   Light can change color when passing through certain blocks
*   Light can be absorbed by specific blocks
*   Emitted colors and filtered colors can be customized in resource packs
*   Block states can define different colors
*   The mod is client-side - you can play with it on ANY server while still experiencing colorful lighting!

# 🔗 Mod Compatibility

*   **Embeddium Support**: Embeddium is fully compatible and a REQUIREMENT.
*   **Starlight Support**: Works seamlessly with Starlight.
*   **True Darkness Support**: Compatible with True Darkness.
*   **Oculus Support**: Colorful Lighting now ships a shaderpack auto-patcher (similar to Euphoria Patches). On startup it scans your `shaderpacks` folder and creates a patched `<Pack> + ColorfulLighting` copy of every recognized pack — select that copy in the Oculus shader GUI and the Colored Light Engine stays enabled. Unpatched packs still disable the engine automatically. Run `/cl patchshaders` to re-scan without restarting, or set `autoPatchShaderpacks = false` in the client config to opt out.
*   **Dynamic Light Mods**: Most Dynamic Light mods are NOW WORKING! [Lively Lighting](https://github.com/Camawama/LivelyLighting) is still the only known working Dynamic Lighting Mod compatible with the filters.json entries.
*   **Wakes: Reforged**: Works perfectly with wakes and tints them accordingly
*   **Flywheel**: Flywheel rendered objects now render with colorful lighting since the Colorful Lighting 2.4.0 update (tested with flywheel 1.0.5).
*   **Distant Horizons**: Lights rendered inside LODs will not have color. This is something we are working on for a future release.
*   **Flerovium**: Held and dropped items will appear dark. This is something we are working on for a future release.
*   **AsyncParticles**: Particles appear dark. This is something we are working on for a future release.
*   **Lively Lighting**: Dynamic light sources will emit light with their respective color. Fixed lingering light!
*   **Immersive Portals**: Does not crash, but the light from the Nether will bleed into the Overworld when an immersive portal is being rendered. This may be fixed in the future.
*   **Ponder (Create)**: Ponder works fine in recent updates, no more red tint issue!

# 🖼️ Resource Pack Tutorial

In your resourcepack's namespace folder (where folders like `textures` and `models` are located), create a `light` folder. There, you can create an `emitters.json` file, which defines what light colors blocks emit.

## emitters.json

This file defines the color of light emitted by blocks. You can specify a simple color or use a more complex object to handle block states.

### Simple Format

```
{
          "minecraft:torch": "vanilla",               // Same color used in Vanilla lighting
    "minecraft:glowstone": "#00FF00",           // color in hex
    "minecraft:red_candle": "red",              // Minecraft dye name
    "minecraft:redstone_lamp": [0,255,255],     // RGB array
    "minecraft:soul_torch": "purple;5",         // override light level emission value after ';' is a hex number from 0 to F (F = 15)
}
```

### Block State Format

You can define different colors for different block states.

```
{
    "minecraft:furnace": {
        "default": "orange",
        "states": {
            "lit=true": "red",
            "lit=false": "#000000"
        }
    }
}
```

## filters.json

This file defines how light is colored when passing through blocks (like stained glass). You can also specify light absorption (0-15), where 0 allows all light to pass and 15 blocks all light.

### Simple Format

```
{
    "minecraft:red_stained_glass": "#00FF00", // color in hex
    "minecraft:green_stained_glass": "red",   // dye name
    "minecraft:glass": [ 0, 255, 255 ],       // RGB array
          "minecraft:oak_door": "white;5"           // light absorption (0=full pass, 15=blocked)
}
```

### Block State Format

Similar to emitters, filters can also depend on block states.

```
{
    "minecraft:stained_glass_pane": {
        "default": "white",
        "states": {
            "waterlogged=true": "blue"
        }
    },
    "minecraft:oak_door": {
    "default": "white;15",
    "states": {
      "open=true": "white;0",
      "open=false": "white;15"
    }
}
```

## absorbers.json

This file defines which blocks will completely eat (absorb) light around them. You can define the color of light it absorbs (or white for all light) as well as how much light it absorbs.

```
{
	"minecraft:end_portal": "#FFFFFF;15",
	"minecraft:end_gateway": "#FFFFFF;15"
}
```

## entities.json

Define what light color entities emit (REQUIRES [LIVELY LIGHTING](https://github.com/Camawama/LivelyLighting)).

```
{
    "minecraft:creeper": "#00FF00", // color in hex
    "minecraft:blaze": "orange"     // dye name
}
```

## items.json

Define what light color held items emit (REQUIRES [LIVELY LIGHTING](https://github.com/Camawama/LivelyLighting)).

```
{
    "minecraft:torch": "#00FF00",     // color in hex
    "minecraft:lava_bucket": "orange" // dye name
}
```

## moon_phases.json

Define a separate light intensity/vibrancy value for each moon phase.

```
{
  "0": 0.45,
  "1": 0.60,
  "2": 0.75,
  "3": 0.90,
  "4": 1.0,
  "5": 0.90,
  "6": 0.75,
  "7": 0.45
}
```

# ‼️ Working Shader Packs

*   [https://github.com/Waterpicker/Super-Duper-Vanilla](https://github.com/Waterpicker/Super-Duper-Vanilla) (patched by hand)

The built-in auto-patcher additionally supports (tested against the versions listed):

| Pack | Colored light quality |
|---|---|
| Complementary Reimagined r5.8.1 (incl. + Euphoria Patches 1.9.3) | Full — tint wired into block lighting |
| Complementary Unbound r5.8.1 (incl. + Euphoria Patches 1.9.3) | Full — tint wired into block lighting |
| rethinking-voxels r0.1-beta9 | Full (also has its own voxel colored light — consider using one or the other) |
| AstraLex V93.0 | Full — tint wired into block lighting (disable its own "Colored Lighting" option) |
| MakeUp Ultra Fast 9.5c | Approximate — weighted vertex-color tint |
| Mellow v3.2 | Approximate — weighted vertex-color tint |
| miniature 2.18.12 | Approximate — weighted vertex-color tint |
| photon v1.3b | Approximate — weighted vertex-color tint (deferred pack) |
| Bliss v2.1.2 | Approximate — weighted vertex-color tint (deferred pack) |

Unknown packs that read the lightmap through standard `gl_MultiTexCoord1` patterns will still get the compatibility decode (correct light levels, no rainbow artifacts), just without the color tint.
